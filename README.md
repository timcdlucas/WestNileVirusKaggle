West Nile Virus Kaggle Competition
===================================


This repo contains code for the West Nile Virus kaggle comp.

[https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus)

The aim of the competition is to predict whether a mosquito trap will contain traps infected with West Nile Virus.
There is a number of things that will make this difficult.
The data are all fairly close together in space, and the weather data is course.
The infection of a mosquito is going to have occured in the past.
The important factors will be "weather two weeks ago" etc., rather than present weather.

I am not allowed to distribute the data so if you want to run his code you need to download and unzip the data into the main repo folder.

My working document is [WNV analysis.R](WNV analysis.R) which is displayed in [WNV analysis.md](WNV analysis.md) or [WNV analyis.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/timcdlucas/WestNileVirusKaggle/blob/master/WNV%20analysis.html) via knitr.

If people are interested in working together on this, get in touch.
